# Sets

## Cartesian Product
- Sets can be "multiplied"  to create a new set. Better known as the [[cartesian product]]
- We can take this a step further.
	- Let A × B is a set of [[ordered pairs]] of elements from A and B. For example, if A = {k, ,m} and B = {q, r} , then
		- A × B =*{ (k, q), (k, r), (l, q), (l, r), (m, q), (m, r) }* 
	- E.g. ℝ x ℝ = { (x, y) : x, y ∈ ℝ }
### Fact
- If A and B are finite sets, then *|A ×B| = |A| · |B|*

### Ordered Triple and Beyond!
- we can go even further than ordered pairs! How cool
- an [[ordered triple]] is a list.
	- E.g.  ℝ×N×Z = { (x, y, z) : x ∈ R, y ∈ N, z ∈ Z }
- this can be expanded to any number of [[sets]] n
	- E.g. A$_1$ × A$_2$ ×···× A$_n$ = { (x$_1$, x$_2$,..., x$_n$) : xi ∈ A$_i$ for each i = 1,2,...,n }

### Space Representation
- using [[cartesian product]], we can represent space!
- For any set A and positive integer n, the Cartesian power A$^2$ is
	- A$_n$ = A × A ×··· × A = { (x$_1$, x$_2$,..., x$_n$) : x$_1$, x$_2$,..., x$_n$ ∈ A }
- R$_2$ is equal to the cartesian plane and R$_3$ is equal to three-dimensional space and so on.
