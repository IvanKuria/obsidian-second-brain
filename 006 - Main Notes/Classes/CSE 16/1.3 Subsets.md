# Sets

### Intro
- elements from one set can be found in another [[set]]
	- E.g. A = { 0,2,4 } is also an element of B = { 0,1,2,3,4 }. When A and B are related this way we say that A is a [[subset]] of B
	-  *A ⊆ B*
- the opposite is also true
	- E.g. *A ⊄ B*

### Fact
- The [[empty set]] is a [[subset]] of all sets, that is, $\emptyset$ ⊆ B for any [[set]] B

### Fact
- If a finite [[set]] has n elements, then it has 2$^n$ [[subset]]s.
